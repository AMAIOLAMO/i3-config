# i3 CX config

A funny little simple config I did.

It uses `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Regular font`

Requires the following to be installed:
```
copyq // X11 clipboard manager

bumblebee-status // used for the display of i3 status bar
rofi // used for better display
brightnessctl // for changing display brightness
nitrogen // wallpaper manager
picom // for transparency and window fading animation
```

Do note that this is just a very simple and basic setup, slightly modified the example config given by i3wm
